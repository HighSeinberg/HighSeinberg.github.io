            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Environmental friendly goals for mobility solutions can be achieved through several ways – modularity, electric drive-train, reducing development time and downtime. Universal Mobility Armoured Mobility Solution (UMAMS) blends in all the factors to develop an eco- friendly solution simplistic framework which has never been attempted before according to our knowledge. The defining concept of the system is modularity. Each and every component that is present in the system can be swapped/ extended/ removed/ upgraded according to the needs specified by user. Current systems that are developed on the principle of modularity mostly allow, users to swap the external functional components with a definite framework (chassis).</p>
            <p>UMAMS however allow users to change the complete framework (chassis) of the vehicle and also the external functional modules. The closest analogy to our system is Body-on-Wheel chassis where chassis represents the framework we are developing and body represents the external functional module and the common connection between the chassis and body is functional bay. In terms of analogy, we are developing a chassis which is modular, and can fit any body (big as truck, bus; small as robotic systems, wheelchair).The other major technological benefit apart from modularity is electric drive, which has enabled us to make a simplistic 4-friendly mobility solution.
            </p>
            <br>


            <h3>Target Customers</h3>
            <p>We are targeting customers in variety of fields (whose application is related to mobility) such as defence establishments, commercial transportation applications, disabled people mobility, security and research firms.
            </p>
            <p>The closest analogy to our system is Body-on-Wheel chassis where chassis represents the framework we are developing and body represents the external functional module and the common connection between the chassis and body is functional bay. Hence , there is an endless possibility and market available.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Project Development</h3>
            <p>We are developing the first prototype of our product and hope to complete it by the end of March, 2018. It will also be the technology demonstrator along with the proof of concept. We have already established the internal communication between modules via CAN Bus and microcontrollers and are working on wireless control of the framework along with the hardware manufacturing.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Sandbox facilities used</h3>
            <p>As the requirements of our design are wide, the facilities required are also very vast and Sandbox has provided us with many of those facilities. We have extensively used 3 D printers for manufacturing of the wheel assembly. Also the workshop equipments provided in the Sandbox has enabled us to manufacture the prototype in the same place as the setup of electronics speeding up our progress. We have used the electronics and general inventory provided by sandbox to a great extent for our requirements.
            </p>
            <p>The environment of work is very essential for the effectiveness of work, and Sandbox has taken up the bar for an inclusive, “chilled” (an AC workshop – how cool is that) and accommodative environment very well suited for working with peace of mind and anytime according to our preferences. Also, sandbox provides us with a place to discuss on the further steps of the project with the whole team.
            </p>
