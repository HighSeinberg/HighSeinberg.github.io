            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>At Imitato Robotics we are building humanoid robots which can be controlled by human wearing an Exo-suit. Robots today are autonomous or instruction controlled, due to which they need to be trained for specific tasks and yet, we get compromised control over the robots. Imitato Robotics aims to solve these problems by designing humanoids which mimic the actions of a human being and hence can perform tasks in new environment based on human intelligence. This also helping to remove the fear for robot AI from people’s minds.</p>
            <p>We achieve perfect human control by designing an exoskeleton suit with haptic control system which is wirelessly connected to our humanoid’s actuators and sensors. The humanoid itself has a very innovative design. We have indigenously designed special joints which help to amplify per motor torque output and provides increased degree of actuator redundancy of the humanoid. This helps us to make less costly humanoids which are more failure resistant, and better human controlled.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Target Customers</h3>
            <p>Any entity which aims to access areas which are hazardous, fatal or commercially unviable for humans to access are our target customers. Currently we are targeting government bodies like municipalities, fire and traffic police department and in long run aim to work with defence ministry. Along with that our product also finds applications in medical field like Robotic Surgery and prosthetic limbs.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Project Development</h3>
            <p>Prototype Development Stage - First prototype, which served as the proof of concept was completed in December’17. Currently we have completed the design of the second one and will be able to build it completely by the end of June’18. In second prototype we will also be integrating advanced sensors and actuators to achieve better accuracy and control. Currently we are only focusing on building the Exo-suit which will serve to capture human movements and detect abnormalities.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Role of Sandbox</h3>
            <p>We use Sandbox mainly for fabrication and testing. Hence the mechanical equipment, 3D printer, TV for Rasp Pi programming and power sources are the major hardware we make use of. Apart from these, we use consumables such as Xbee, potentiometers, Arduino, Accelometers, Gyroscopes, etc. for hardware designing. Also the clean room of Sandbox allows us to test our signal ranges and Packet Delivery Ratio.
            </p>
            <p>Starting from the ideation phase of our project in May 2017 to the first prototype of lower body of the humanoid robot and its integration with Exo-suit, Sandbox facilities have enabled us to experiment and reiterate our product. With the help of Sandbox facilities we have been able to build the lower body of the humanoid, Exo-suit and the indigenous mechanisms to increase the degrees of award for feasible technological innovation and win it, which in turn has increased freedom in robotic limbs. Owing to the progress we made using the facilities and equipment available there, we were able to successfully pitch our idea for prestigious the pace of the progress of our project. </p>
